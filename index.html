        <p>My name is David Banda and I am a student at BYU Pathway. I am currently studying Web Development and Design. 
            I am a full-time student and I am also working full-time. I am a very busy person but I am determined to finish my degree. 
            I am currently working on my second degree. I have a degree in Computer Information Systems and I am currently working on 
            my Web Development and Design degree. I am very excited to learn more about web development and design. I am also excited to 
            learn more about the different programming languages that are used in web development. I am also excited to learn more about 
            the different design tools that are used in web design. I am looking forward to learning more about web development and design.
